Thatâ€™s why the philosophers warn us not to be satisfied with mere learning, but to add practice and then training. For as time passes we forget what we learned and end up doing the opposite, and hold opinions the opposite of what we should. ~Epictetus
%
The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control.

%
As human beings, our job in life is to help people realize how rare and valuable each one of us really is, that each of us has something that no one else has or ever will have something inside that is unique to all time. It's our job to encourage each other to discover that uniqueness and to provide ways of developing its expression. ~Mr Rogers
%
Discovering the truth about ourselves is a lifetime's work, but it's worth the effort. ~Mr Rogers

Forgiveness is a strange thing. It can sometimes be easier to forgive our enemies than our friends. It can be hardest of all to forgive people we love.

The connections we make in the course of a life, maybe that's what heaven is. ~Mr Rogers

The greatest gift you ever give is your honest self. ~Mr Rogers

%
The only thing evil can't stand is forgiveness. ~Mr Rogers
%

%
We all have different gifts, so we all have different ways of saying to the world who we are. ~Mr Rogers
%
We get so wrapped up in numbers in our society. The most important thing is that we are able to be one-to-one, you and I with each other at the moment. If we can be present to the moment with the person that we happen to be with, that's what's important. ~Mr Rogers
%
We speak with more than our mouths. We listen with more than our ears. ~Mr Rogers

Who you are inside is what helps you make and do everything in life. ~Mr Rogers
