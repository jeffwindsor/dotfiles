# Claude Code Global Preferences (MANDATORY)

This file defines **non-optional** coding and testing standards. These preferences **override default Claude behavior**. Claude must adhere to these unless explicitly instructed otherwise within a specific prompt.

---

## TESTING STANDARDS

### Test Architecture

- Prefer **stubs**, not mock frameworks.
- Drive **non-determinism to the edges** of the system (e.g., time, DB, I/O). Inject such dependencies.
- Write **deep tests** through public interfaces; stub only edge dependencies.
- Prefer **builders over fixtures** to create test data.
- Each test must be:
  - **Self-contained**
  - **Minimal** (setup only what is needed)
  - **Deterministic** and independent
  - **Focused on intent**, not implementation details

### Test Performance

- Ideal: **< 10ms**
- Warning: **> 20ms**
- Failure: **> 100ms**
- Disallowed: File system, network, DB, or global resources (time, env vars)
- Allow only: CPU, heap, stack

### Test Reliability

- Tests must run in **any order**
- Disallow **shared state**
- Duplicate logic goes into **test-only stubs/fakes**
- Never reuse stub instances
- Tests must not use system time or env vars directly

### Test Readability

- Inputs/outputs must be **human-understandable**
- Prefer strings, ints, bools – avoid paths, byte arrays
- Keep test data small, relevant, clear
- Delegate complexity to test utility classes

### Test Types – Correct Usage Only

| Type            | Allowed Use                                                                                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unit**        | For all logic, prefer tests at teh outer boundary of code (the input to storage and non-determinism) |
| **Integration** | Only for cross-boundary checks (e.g., DB)                                                            |
| **End-to-End**  | Only for smoke/perf on deploy; not in build                                                          |
| **Regression**  | For large critical datasets; must document                                                           |
| **Manual**      | Only if result requires human visual check                                                           |

### Test Naming & Structure

- Use `@Nested` classes like `WhenX`, `GivenY`, `WithZ` for scenario grouping
- Method names: `shouldDoXWhenY`
- Use `@DisplayName` for business-readable titles
- Structure tests with clear sections: `// Setup`, `// Execute`, `// Verify`
- Use **dedicated, reusable assertion helpers** (`assertSuccess()`, `assertOutput()`)

---

## CODE STYLE STANDARDS

### Core Principles

- Favor **composition** over inheritance
- Use **builders** for complex data creation
- Use **immutable** structures where practical
- Keep methods **short, focused, expressive**
- Variable and method names must express **business intent**

### Error Handling

- Use **functional constructs** (`Either`, `Optional`) where applicable
    - Prefer Structured Enums over String as Left type
    - Enums should not be mixed between concerns or layers
- Do not throw exceptions for expected cases
- All error messages must be **clear and actionable**

### Dependency Guidelines

- Minimize 3rd-party dependencies
- Prefer **standard library** and idiomatic patterns
- Always use **dependency injection**
- Avoid static accessors, global state, or hidden dependencies

---

## SPRING BOOT CONFIGURATION

### Security

- All secrets must be sourced from **environment variables** only
- Use `${ENV_VAR}` in `application.properties`, **never** hardcode credentials

### Config Management

- Prefer `application.properties` over `@Configuration` classes for simple configs
- Use Spring Boot property binding over custom config classes
- Avoid scattering `@Value` injections – consolidate config
- Set default values: `${DB_HOST:localhost}`

### Spring Boot Code Hygiene

- Remove redundant `@Configuration` classes
- Favor **declarative** config (properties, annotations) over imperative logic

---

## DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS

### Code Documentation
- Code must be **self-documenting** by naming
- Comments should explain **why**, not **what**
- Public APIs must include JavaDoc
- Keep documentation close to the relevant code

### Project Documentation Structure

#### Organization Philosophy
- **Break up large pages** (>200-300 lines) into focused, topic-specific files
- **Create overview/index pages** with comprehensive navigation rather than monolithic documents
- **Maintain hierarchical organization** with clear parent-child relationships using `docs/topic/subtopic.md` patterns
- **Use consistent directory structures** that group related content logically

#### Navigation Requirements (MANDATORY)
- **Always include breadcrumb navigation** (`← Back to [Parent Page]`) at the top of sub-pages
- **Add comprehensive table of contents** to overview pages with deep links to sections
- **Include cross-reference links** between related sections at page endings
- **Create quick navigation sections** organized by use case, component type, or task
- **Provide multiple navigation paths** (by topic, by component, by workflow)

#### Content Structure Standards
- **Start with clear purpose statements** explaining what each document covers
- **Include practical examples** and command-line instructions where applicable
- **Add "Related Documentation" sections** at the end of pages with links to relevant content
- **Use tables for overview information** with descriptions, counts, and metrics
- **Maintain consistent formatting** and structure patterns across all documentation

#### Specific Patterns to Follow
- **Testing documentation**: Break into focused areas (core logic, security, validation, infrastructure, metrics, integration) with comprehensive overview page
- **Long technical documents** (>200 lines): Add comprehensive TOCs with nested navigation structure
- **Cross-linking strategy**: Each page should link to related pages and provide easy "up" navigation
- **File naming**: Use descriptive, hyphenated names (`core-business-logic.md`, `security-tests.md`)

#### Quality Standards
- **Preserve technical depth** while improving organization and discoverability
- **Keep all critical information** when restructuring - never lose content for the sake of organization
- **Maintain consistency** with existing excellent patterns (like main README navigation)
- **Focus on discoverability** without sacrificing content quality or completeness
