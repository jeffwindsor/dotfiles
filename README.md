## The files 

Configuration files in (\*)NIX systems usually start with a 'dot'.  Examples include directories and files like: `~/.config`,  `~/.zshrc` and `~/.gitconfig`. These files can exist at any location but are usually found in your home directory `~/` and in the [XDG_CONFIG_HOME](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) directory, which by convention is usually `~/.config`.

## Keeping a history of content changes

This portion is optional, but recommended so that you easily tag, comment and find past historical changes.  This repository uses [git](https://git-scm.com/), as such it utilises a central location for all my current configurations. These central files are linked to the home directory structure using a local dotfile management strategy discussed below.

## Backing up and sharing

This repository uses [github](www.github.com) to keep a central copy of my configuration and associated git repository.  This central location allows for easy sharing between machines with a simple `git clone`.  I prefer to clone this repository locally into `~/.dotfiles`.

## Local dotfile manangement strategy

Given the configuration files are centrally located and not in expected locations in home directory, we need a tool and a strategy to make them useable on a machine.  Currently I utilize [gnu-stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) as a tool along with three script files for automation.  Gnu stow has a set of capabilities that leads to a strategy of composing the linkage of configuraiton files, and thus allows for more flexibility.

### How the strategy works

The dotfiles are packaged into "configuration" folders, such as the below neovim configuration.

<pre>
~/.dotfiles/nvim/.config
├── nvim
│  ├── autosave.vim
│  ├── fzf.vim
│  ├── init.vim
│  ├── nerd-tree.vim
│  └── vim-sneak.vim
└── zsh
   └── nvim
</pre>

When a configuration folder is "added" to the current system, stow will link the highest file/folder appropriate based on current files in the target directory.  

<pre>
~/.config
├── nvim -> ../.dotfiles/nvim/.config/nvim
└── zsh
   └── nvim -> ../../.dotfiles/nvim/.config/zsh/nvim
</pre>

### Automation scripts

There are three script files that help automate linking the dotfile configuration folder content to the users home directory:

* `./add {dotfile-configuration-folder}` - links a single configuration folder to the system
* `./remove {dotfile-configuration-folder}` - removes a single configuration folder from the system
* `./config {stows-file}` - removes and re-adds a list of configuration folders (listed in the stows-file), automating a complete machine configuration
    
Most of the time I use add or remove to test configurations.  Then use the stows files to setup a new machine or refresh a specific machine.

## You have options to do this differently

Multiple strategies have been devised to backup, share, and keep change history of files.  If this repos approach is not to your liking you can find alternative [tools](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles#tools) and [tutorials](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles#articles) to accomplish the same ends but in different ways.
